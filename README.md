# bruhbot
*The bot written by nobody.*

This bot was written with Github Copilot almost exclusively.
All of the features were written with Copilot, and Copilot cameup with the architecture (which is why there's so many 10 line files).
Most of the ideas for the commands were also generated by Copilot.

## Usage
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To use admin commands, you need to give yourself a role with the name `Admin`.

Example config (put in config.json):
```
{
  "token": "<your bot's token>",
  "prefix": "+",
  "weatherApiKey": "<openweathermap api key>"
}
```
